# ≈çkiidoku

The project currently provides a full-grid generator, and has in the works a canonicalizer and database-like utilities for compressed storage of solution and puzzle grids. In the (far) future, it will include a solver and a puzzle generator. It supports parametric grid size (most other sudoku projects do not). The generator uses a [stochastic search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku_solving_algorithms#Stochastic_search_/_optimization_methods) algorithm, which was found to scale much better than a backtracking algorithm for very large grid sizes. The canonicalizer is currently under progress; I am experimenting with a novel approach using intrinsic statistics/characteristics of grids.

Language-implementation independent design notes can be found in the [design folder](./writings/design/). These are not specs or usage documentation. They are collections of the goals I have and the considerations I made in designing the containers and algorithms for the library.

In Japanese, "ookii" means "big". I chose the name because one of my priorities for this project is to support variable grid sizes, and to find algorithms that scale well with increased size. Also, I thought the name had a nice ring- like "okey-dokey". I decided not to call the project "ookiidoku" (despite that being the proper romanization) out of fear of english speakers like myself mispronouncing it like a monkey sound.

I work on this project for fun. I like sudoku. I want to learn how to develop high-performance software libraries. I like reasoning about trade-offs. The algorithm design is like the puzzle to me; I don't want to "look at answers" until I have tried my best come up with my own. Perhaps in doing so, I will come up with something new, and maybe even something that is better in some ways than existing approaches.

## Usage

See the readme in the [cpp](./cpp/readme.md) directory.

Right now I don't really have the motivation to maintain inline (in the source code) documentation about Sudoku terminology/concepts and algorithm descriptions, or on top of that to learn how to generate doc pages with tools like Doxygen. I'll only start doing that if I think I can commit to keeping them very clean and up to date. Again, there's the design folder. All you will find in source code is contracts and post-conditions.

This project is MIT licensed. If something does not work for you, you can always do your own work and adapt it for your own needs (while respecting the terms of the licence).

The project is still in its early stages. It it not stable. You can find [its roadmap here](./cpp/TODO.md). While I'd like to have cross-platform support and support for most popular compilers, it's not one of my current priorities. I also prioritize using modern toolchain and c++ standard library features over supporting older ones.

If you have a question about the project and whether it is suitable for your own goals, please do your own research about [other existing projects](#other-existing-projects-and-solvers) and what they provide, and read through this project's [design docs](./writings/design/) before asking. If you aren't familiar with C++ and its tooling ecosystem, please do your homework before asking me questions. While I can sympathize (I am also learning), to put it bluntly, I am not here to teach you those kinds of things.

- If it works for you and you do something cool with it, that's great! I'd love to hear about it.
- If you find configuration issues that prevent you from building the project using recent versions of a popular toolchain and you know how to fix it and submit a pull request, I will happily look at it, likely merge it in, and be very grateful.
- If you have a suggestion of how the library could be improved and you present a case, I will engage in discussion with you. Where applicable, benchmarks would also be appreciated.

## My Past and Future Related Works

Sudoku is a favourite puzzle game of mine. After I took an intro to programming course in my first year of university, one of [my first personal projects](https://github.com/david-fong/my-first-projects) was a solution generator in C. The code was terrible, but I still remember the feelings of excitement and enjoyment that I felt. I reworked it after learning Java (private repo), then later started this. I've attempted a [hardware implementation using SystemVerilog](https://github.com/david-fong/Sudoku-SV), which so far has been a failure (probably due to too many wires).
