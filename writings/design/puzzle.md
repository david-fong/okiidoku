# Puzzles

## Puzzle Generation

Goals: Generate minimal, difficult puzzles. TODO: by what definition of difficulty?

## Solver

There are two paths here: one is to create a solver that purely optimizes for speed/throughput, and the other is to prioritize using human solving strategies and be able to rank the difficulty of the puzzle based on the difficulty of techniques used.
