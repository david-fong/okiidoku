- I have zero experience or background in rust.
- But I have constant haunting fear that everything would have been / be better for me if I had just started by using it instead of c++.
- Certainly it's nice to have a single compiler, package manager, and standard library implementation (at least I _think_ that's how it is with rust?), and have them all installable and upgradable together with a single tool.
- I think it's pretty cross platform too?
- It got to learn a lot from its predecessors.

I feel really envious of how clean and declarative the project configuration files are when I look at emerentius's projects.
