# Finding Subsets

Date: 2022/June/13

Did some comparison for finding subsets. Used the puzzle maker with order 5, and waited until 249 puzcell candidates remained. For no subset finding, it took 2m48s. For full subset finding with empty guess stack, it took 2m28s. For finding subsets of size 2 regardless of guess stack depth, it took 1m48s.
